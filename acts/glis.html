        <div class="bio">
            <p>Glis is an electronic music project from Seattle, founded in 2001 by Shaun Frandsen, that spans the genres of electro-industrial, futurepop, synthpop, and EBM. The project emerged during the early 2000s renaissance of electronic body music and quickly established itself as a significant voice in the scene with the release of "Extract" (2001), which demonstrated Frandsen's ability to blend aggressive electronic rhythms with melodic sensibilities that would become the project's trademark.</p>
            
            <p>The project's discography includes landmark releases such as "Nemesis" (2005), which helped solidify Glis's reputation in the international futurepop community, and more recent works including the comeback album "Gateway to Oblivion" in 2024. This latest release marked a significant return for the project after a period of relative quiet, demonstrating that Frandsen's vision for electronic music remains relevant and compelling in the contemporary landscape. The album showcased a mature approach to the electronic genres that have defined Glis while incorporating modern production techniques.</p>
            
            <p>Glis maintains an exceptionally active presence on Bandcamp, with recent releases including "A Different Dream" (2025), "Winterwerk vol. 1," and "CruSh" (2025 mix), demonstrating the project's continued productivity and evolution. This consistent output reflects both Frandsen's dedication to the project and the supportive community that has grown around Glis's music over more than two decades. The project's longevity and continued relevance speak to the enduring appeal of well-crafted electronic music that balances dancefloor functionality with emotional depth.</p>
