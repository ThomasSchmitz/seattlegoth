            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Assemblage 23 has been long associated with the Seattle music scene, with founder Tom Shear becoming a significant figure in the Pacific Northwest's electronic body music (EBM) and futurepop community. Based in Seattle for many years, Shear operated his 23db record label from the city, which became a platform for other Washington-based electronic acts. The project's deep roots in Seattle have made it an integral part of the local industrial and electronic music ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Assemblage 23 is a one-man futurepop and electronic body music (EBM) project created by Tom Shear, who began crafting emotionally driven electronic compositions in the late 1980s. What started as a personal creative outlet evolved into a major international act that helped define the futurepop genre. Shear's approach to electronic music combines the mechanical precision of EBM with melodic sensibilities and deeply personal lyrical content, creating a sound that is both dancefloor-friendly and introspectively compelling.</p>
            
            <p>The project's evolution from underground electronic experiment to internationally recognized act mirrors the broader development of the futurepop genre itself. Assemblage 23's music features sophisticated programming, lush synthesizer work, and Shear's distinctive vocals, which range from whispered confessions to soaring anthems. Albums like "Failure," "Storm," and "Meta" established the project as a leader in the genre, with tracks that became staples of gothic and industrial club nights worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Beyond his work as Assemblage 23, Tom Shear has been instrumental in fostering the Seattle electronic music scene through his 23db Records label, which he operated from Seattle for many years. The label became a crucial platform for Pacific Northwest electronic acts, most notably releasing the debut album "Obsolete" by fellow Seattle-based band Backandtotheleft in 2004. Shear's side projects, including the experimental Nerve Filter, demonstrate his versatility as a producer and his commitment to exploring different facets of electronic music, from ambient textures to harsher industrial sounds.</p>
            
            <p>The project's influence extends beyond music production into the broader gothic and industrial community. Assemblage 23's emotionally resonant tracks have become anthems for the darkwave scene, with songs exploring themes of isolation, connection, and human resilience. This multi-faceted approach has made Assemblage 23 not just a band, but a cornerstone of the Pacific Northwest's electronic music community and a bridge between the underground EBM scene and mainstream dark electronic music.</p>
