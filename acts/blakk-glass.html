            <strong>Washington State Connection:</strong> Seattle-based darkwave project founded by Shane Allen Hall (formerly of The Break Up), representing the contemporary Pacific Northwest darkwave and synthpop scene.
        </div>
        
        <div class="bio">
            <p>Blakk Glass emerged from Seattle's darkwave scene as the creative vision of Shane Allen Hall, who brought his experience from previous work with The Break Up to create a new project that would blend darkwave, electronic indie, and synthpop into a cohesive artistic statement.</p>
            
            <p>The project expanded to include talented collaborators Sarah Stewart, Mike Wimer, and vocalist Franki Deetz, creating a dynamic ensemble that brings both instrumental depth and vocal versatility to their atmospheric compositions. This collaborative approach allows Blakk Glass to explore different sonic territories while maintaining their core darkwave identity.</p>
            
            <p>In May 2017, Blakk Glass released their "Trial" EP, a seven-track collection that showcased the project's range and artistic vision. The EP featured Shane on keys and vocals alongside Franki Deetz on vocals, and included alternate versions of songs that were planned for their full-length album, giving listeners a preview of the band's creative process and evolutionary approach to songwriting.</p>
            
            <p>The band's sound draws from the rich tradition of darkwave while incorporating modern electronic indie and synthpop elements that reflect Seattle's diverse and innovative music scene. Their music creates atmospheric soundscapes that balance darkness with melody, offering both emotional depth and danceability.</p>
            
            <p>As part of Seattle's contemporary darkwave movement, Blakk Glass represents the ongoing evolution of dark electronic music in the Pacific Northwest. Their work demonstrates how established darkwave traditions can be reimagined through fresh perspectives and modern production techniques, contributing to the city's reputation as a hub for innovative alternative music.</p>
