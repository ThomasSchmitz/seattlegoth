            <p>2Libras is a Seattle-based cyberpunk/dark electro duo comprising Wesley and Jewels Foster-Rogers.

        <div class="bio">
            <p>2Libras represents the cutting edge of Seattle's cyberpunk and dark electro scene, crafting a distinctive sound that blends darkwave, dark electro, synthpop, industrial, and hard rock elements. The duo's music evokes a chaotic, dystopian aesthetic that perfectly captures the post-industrial urban landscape of the Pacific Northwest. Wesley and Jewels Foster-Rogers have built their reputation on creating immersive sonic experiences that transport listeners to a world of neon-lit streets and technological alienation.</p>
            
            <p>The band's approach to electronic music is both innovative and deeply rooted in the traditions of industrial and darkwave music. Their compositions feature heavy use of synthesizers, drum machines, and processed vocals, creating layered soundscapes that are both danceable and introspective. The cyberpunk influence is evident not only in their music but also in their visual aesthetic and lyrical themes, which often explore concepts of technological dependency, urban decay, and human-machine interfaces.</p>
            
            <p>Recognition came in 2023 when 2Libras was awarded Best Electronic Band at the Washington State Independent Music Awards, a significant achievement that highlighted their contribution to the local music scene. This award not only recognized their musical talent but also their role in maintaining Seattle's reputation as a hub for innovative electronic music, continuing the city's legacy that spans from early industrial pioneers to contemporary dark electronic acts.</p>
