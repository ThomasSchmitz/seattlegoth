# Washington State Musical Acts Project

This directory contains webpages for 84 Washington State gothic, industrial, and dark alternative musical acts.

## Structure

- `index.html` - Main listing page showing all 84 acts
- `TEMPLATE.html` - Template for creating new band pages
- `images/` - Directory for band images
- Individual HTML files for each band (e.g., `2libras.html`, `assemblage-23.html`)

## Completed Pages

Currently completed pages with full research and content:
- `2libras.html` - 2Libras (Seattle cyberpunk/dark electro duo)
- `assemblage-23.html` - Assemblage 23 (Tom Shear's futurepop/EBM project)
- `dead-spells.html` - Dead Spells (Seattle darkwave/post-punk band)

## Page Format

Each band page follows this consistent structure:

### Required Elements:
1. **Band Name (H1)** - Main heading
2. **Location** - Primary Washington State location
3. **Image** - Band photo or artwork (to be added to `images/` directory)
4. **Years Active** - Period of activity
5. **Washington State Connection** - How the band relates to WA State
6. **Bio** - 1-3 paragraphs covering band history, style, and significance
7. **Links** - Bandcamp, official websites, social media, notable releases

### Style
- Dark gothic theme with red and green accent colors
- Consistent typography using Georgia serif font
- Responsive design suitable for desktop and mobile
- Navigation back to main index

## Research Sources

Band information compiled from:
- `../research/WA-State-Music-Acts.txt` - Complete list of 84 bands
- `../research/early-research.txt` - Detailed research on many bands including:
  - Bandcamp pages and discographies
  - Social media profiles
  - Music festival appearances
  - Genre classifications and descriptions
  - Band member information
  - Years of activity

## Creating New Pages

To create a new band page:

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.html` to new filename (e.g., `band-name.html`)
2. Replace all placeholder text marked with `[BRACKETS]`
3. Research the band using available sources
4. Add band image to `images/` directory if available
5. Update the main `index.html` to mark the page as completed (add `completed` class)

## Bands to Skip

- **Mossback** - Explicitly excluded per project requirements

## Remaining Work

81 bands still need individual pages created. Priority should be given to bands with:
- Strong Washington State connections
- Available Bandcamp/online presence
- Rich biographical information
- Active or historically significant in the scene

The template and examples provide a clear framework for completing the remaining pages systematically.
