            <p>The band became an important part of the Northwest industrial underground during the 1990s, helping to define a uniquely Pacific Northwest approach to industrial metal. Their music featured heavily distorted guitars, programmed drums and electronics, and vocals that ranged from guttural death metal growls to industrial barks and screams.</p>
            
            <p>And Christ Wept achieved broader recognition when they were featured on Metal Massacre XII, a compilation series known for launching the careers of many metal bands. Though the band eventually disbanded, they remain an important part of Seattle's dark music history, representing the heavier end of the city's diverse gothic and industrial spectrum.</p>
