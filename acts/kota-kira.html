            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Kota Kira operates from Washington State as an occult dance music producer and the front-woman for Dekira. Her work contributes to the state's diverse dark electronic music scene, bringing witch-house and darkwave influences to the Pacific Northwest's already rich gothic and industrial landscape.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Kota Kira emerges as a distinctive voice in the contemporary occult dance music scene, serving as both a solo artist and the front-woman for the project Dekira. Her music represents a compelling fusion of witch-house, darkwave, and electronic elements, creating atmospheric soundscapes that blend mystical themes with dancefloor sensibilities. Kira's approach to music production emphasizes both the spiritual and physical aspects of electronic music, crafting tracks that work equally well for introspective listening and for moving bodies in dark club environments.</p>
            
            <p>Her artistic vision extends beyond pure musical composition to encompass rich visual aesthetics and carefully curated physical releases. Kira's commitment to creating comprehensive artistic experiences is evident in her attention to limited-edition physical formats and visually rich presentations that complement her sonic explorations. This holistic approach to artistic creation places her within a tradition of electronic artists who view their work as multimedia experiences rather than simply audio recordings.</p>
            
            <p>Kota Kira's recent Bandcamp activity showcases her evolving sound and creative partnerships. Her 2021 release "The Netherworld Beckons" was issued as a limited digipak edition featuring tracks like "The Netherworld Beckons (feat. Vila)," "Moon Dancer," and "Mirror Image" through Re:Mission Entertainment. More recently, her April 2025 cover of "Bloody Tears" from Castlevania demonstrates her ability to reinterpret classic video game music through her occult dance lens, continuing her relationship with Re:Mission Entertainment and showing her range as both an original composer and creative interpreter.</p>
