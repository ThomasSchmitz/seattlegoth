            <p>Night Terrors is a Bremerton-based dark electronic trio that produces danceable EBM (Electronic Body Music) and synth-punk with a raw, intense sound aesthetic. The band combines the driving rhythms of classic EBM with the aggressive edge of synth-punk, creating compositions that are both club-friendly and confrontational in their sonic approach.</p>
            
            <p>The trio has maintained an active presence in the Pacific Northwest dark electronic scene, with notable releases including their contribution to a split album with Chrome Corpse, which demonstrates their collaborative approach to the underground music community. This split release showcases their ability to work within the broader network of dark alternative artists while maintaining their distinctive sound identity.</p>
            
            <p>Their Bandcamp presence features their album "ZENITH" along with their full discography, providing fans access to their complete catalog of dark electronic compositions. The availability of their full discography online demonstrates their commitment to accessibility for underground music fans and their understanding of how contemporary dark electronic music is distributed and discovered by new audiences.</p>
