            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Faith & Disease was a foundational band in Seattle's ethereal wave and darkwave scene, emerging during the early 1990s alongside the city's grunge explosion. The band contributed significantly to establishing Seattle as a center for diverse alternative music beyond just grunge, helping to nurture the Pacific Northwest's ethereal and gothic music communities that continue to thrive today.</p>

            <p>Faith & Disease was an ethereal wave/darkwave project from Seattle, founded in 1991 by vocalist Dara Rosenwasser and guitarist Eric Cooley. Their lush, melancholic sound drew frequent comparisons to influential acts like Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance, establishing them as pioneers of the ethereal wave genre in the Pacific Northwest. The band's music was characterized by atmospheric textures, haunting vocals, and intricate guitar work that created immersive sonic landscapes.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout their fifteen-year career, Faith & Disease released several acclaimed albums that showcased their evolving artistic vision. Key releases included "Beauty and Bitterness" (1994), "Insularia" (1998), "Beneath the Trees" (2000), and "Passport to Kunming" (2003). Each album demonstrated the band's growing sophistication in crafting ethereal soundscapes while maintaining the emotional depth that made their music so compelling. Their work influenced numerous subsequent artists in the ethereal and darkwave genres.</p>
            
            <p>Faith & Disease performed extensively through 2006, becoming a beloved fixture in Seattle's alternative music scene and touring beyond the Pacific Northwest to share their music with ethereal wave enthusiasts across the country. The band's legacy continues to influence contemporary darkwave and ethereal artists, and several former members, including John Clough who later formed Johnny Forlorn, have continued to contribute to Seattle's gothic and darkwave music community. Though no longer active, Faith & Disease remains a revered name in the history of Seattle's diverse alternative music landscape.</p>
