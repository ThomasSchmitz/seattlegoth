            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Famine Harvest is a Seattle-based industrial-black-metal project initiated in 2014, representing the aggressive evolution of the Pacific Northwest's extreme underground music scene. The project builds on the region's established foundation of industrial and alternative acts while pushing into heavier, more confrontational territory.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Famine Harvest emerged from Seattle's underground music scene in 2014 as the brainchild of r_Wilhelm, an artist with connections to the established Washington State alternative music community, including ties to acts like Backandtotheleft. The project represents a departure into more aggressive sonic territory, blending industrial soundscapes with black metal intensity.</p>
            
            <p>The project has developed a substantial discography over its decade of existence, with releases that showcase an evolution in both production quality and compositional complexity. Notable releases include "Zaraza" (2022) and "Zerstoren" (2024), with the most recent offering "Czerwona Reka" released in May 2025, demonstrating the project's continued creative momentum.</p>
            
            <p>Famine Harvest maintains an active presence in the digital music landscape through Bandcamp, where their complete discography is available, featuring nine releases that document the project's journey from its early experimental phases to its current mature sound. The project represents the continuing evolution of Seattle's extreme music scene, bridging the gap between the city's established industrial heritage and contemporary extreme metal expressions.</p>
