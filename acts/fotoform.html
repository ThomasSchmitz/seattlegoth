        <div class="bio">
            <p>Fotoform emerged from Seattle's diverse alternative music scene as a band committed to blending multiple atmospheric genres into a cohesive artistic vision. Their approach combines post-punk energy with darkwave atmosphere, shoegaze textures, and dream-pop sensibilities, creating music that feels both nostalgic and forward-thinking. This multi-genre approach reflects Seattle's historical openness to musical experimentation and genre-blending.</p>
            
            <p>The band's debut self-titled album, released in 2017, established them as serious contributors to Seattle's alternative music landscape. The release was followed by "Horizons," a sophomore effort that demonstrated their continued growth and refinement. Both albums received critical attention from respected music publications including The Big Takeover, highlighting Fotoform's ability to create music that resonates beyond local scene boundaries while maintaining their distinctly Pacific Northwest aesthetic.</p>
            
            <p>Fotoform's recognition by KEXP, Seattle's internationally influential radio station, underscores their significance within the city's music community. Their sound, characterized by atmospheric guitars, layered synthesizers, and ethereal vocals, positions them as inheritors of Seattle's tradition of creating music that captures both urban melancholy and natural beauty. Their active Bandcamp presence ensures accessibility for fans of underground and alternative music, while their consistent output demonstrates long-term commitment to artistic development.</p>
