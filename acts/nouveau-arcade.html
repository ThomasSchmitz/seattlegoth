        <div class="bio">
            <p>Nouveau Arcade is a Seattle-based duo that blends modwave, synthwave, cyberpunk, and retrowave influences to create neon-soaked electronic compositions with a distinctly nostalgic flair. Their music captures the aesthetic of 1980s electronic music while incorporating modern production techniques and contemporary songwriting approaches, resulting in a sound that feels both familiar and innovative.</p>
            
            <p>The duo's approach to electronic composition emphasizes visual and sonic aesthetics that evoke cyberpunk and retro-futuristic themes. Their music combines lush synthesizer work with driving rhythms, creating compositions that work equally well for active listening and background atmosphere. This visual-sonic integration reflects the contemporary synthwave movement's emphasis on multimedia artistic expression.</p>
            
            <p>Their Bandcamp presence features "Dead Hearts" (2023), a full album that mixes goth disco, summer synth, and cyber rhythms, demonstrating their ability to blend different electronic subgenres into a cohesive artistic statement.
