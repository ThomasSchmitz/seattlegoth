            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Backandtotheleft (also stylized as BackAndToTheLeft) emerged from the Seattle electronic music scene as a futurepop/synthpop trio that exemplified the creative cross-pollination within the Pacific Northwest's tight-knit industrial community. The band's formation was rooted in the dissolution of Noxious Emotion, with members seeking a new creative direction that would blend melodic sensibilities with the mechanical precision of electronic body music.</p>

            <p>Backandtotheleft (also stylized as BackAndToTheLeft) emerged from the Seattle electronic music scene as a futurepop/synthpop trio that exemplified the creative cross-pollination within the Pacific Northwest's tight-knit industrial community. The band's formation was rooted in the dissolution of Noxious Emotion, with members seeking a new creative direction that would blend melodic sensibilities with the mechanical precision of electronic body music.</p>
            
            <p>The core lineup evolved to include Brandon Jerwa on vocals, bringing his distinctive voice to the project's emotionally resonant compositions. Megan "Fritter" Mace contributed drums and percussion, adding organic rhythmic elements to their electronic foundation, while Robert Wilhelm provided keyboards and synthesizers that formed the backbone of their lush, layered sound. This combination of human and machine elements became their signature approach, creating music that was both technologically sophisticated and deeply human.</p>
            
            <p>Their breakthrough came with the 2004 release of "Obsolete" on Tom Shear's 23db Records, marking a significant moment for Seattle's futurepop scene. The album's success led to its reissue by Metropolis Records in 2005, bringing the band to international attention and cementing their place in the broader EBM/futurepop community. The Metropolis Records relationship represented validation from one of the genre's most respected labels, known for releases by VNV Nation, And One, and other futurepop luminaries.</p>
            
            <p>Backandtotheleft's connection to Assemblage 23 through the 23db label illustrates the collaborative nature of Seattle's electronic music scene, where established artists actively supported emerging talent. Their sound combined the dancefloor appeal of classic EBM with the melodic accessibility of synthpop, creating tracks that worked equally well in dark clubs and home listening environments. This balance between accessibility and underground credibility helped define a distinctly Pacific Northwest approach to futurepop.</p>
