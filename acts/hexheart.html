            <p>Hexheart is the darkwave/synth-pop project of Seattle-based musician-producer Jasyn Bangert, who is also known for his work with God Module. Operating from Seattle, Hexheart represents the city's continued evolution in electronic and darkwave music, building upon the foundation established by earlier Seattle acts while exploring retro New Wave territories with a modern dark alternative twist.</p>

            <p>Hexheart emerged in 2017 as the creative outlet for Jasyn Bangert, a prominent figure in Seattle's dark electronic music scene who is also known for his work with God Module. The project represents a more nostalgic and melodic exploration of darkwave and synth-pop, blending retro New Wave aesthetics with contemporary production techniques and emotional depth. Bangert's approach with Hexheart demonstrates his versatility as a musician, moving from the harder industrial sounds of God Module to the more nuanced and atmospheric territories of darkwave.</p>
            
            <p>The project's debut album "Midnight On A Moonless Night" arrived in 2017, establishing Hexheart's distinctive sound palette of nostalgic vocals, emotional vocoded lyrics, and carefully crafted synthesizer arrangements. The album features standout tracks like "Nothing," "A Thousand Times," and "Hollywood," each showcasing Bangert's ability to balance melancholy with accessibility. The compositions draw heavily from 1980s new wave traditions while maintaining a contemporary dark alternative edge that resonates with modern audiences.</p>
            
            <p>Hexheart's creative output continued with 2022's "Funeral Flowers," which demonstrated the project's artistic growth and deepening emotional complexity. The album includes tracks such as "Erase Yesterday" and a reimagined version of The Cure's "The Funeral Party," highlighting Bangert's respect for darkwave's gothic roots while establishing his own creative voice. The project maintains an active Bandcamp presence, connecting with fans of both nostalgic synth-pop and contemporary darkwave. Hexheart's releases have been supported by labels including Hypnotic Records, positioning the project within the broader international darkwave community while maintaining its Seattle roots.</p>
