        <div class="bio">
            <p>Prelude to a Pistol is a Seattle-based rock band known for blending brooding, gothic-inflected rock with influences drawn from seminal dark alternative acts including Killing Joke, Danzig, Sisters of Mercy, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. Their sound incorporates the atmospheric depth and emotional intensity characteristic of these influences while developing a contemporary approach to gothic rock that reflects Seattle's musical environment.</p>
            
            <p>The band's musical approach is often described as "gunpowder lullabies with dark overtones," suggesting a combination of aggressive and melodic elements that creates compositions both confrontational and emotionally engaging. This stylistic description reflects their ability to balance the harder elements drawn from industrial and post-punk influences with the more atmospheric and melancholic aspects characteristic of gothic rock.</p>
            
            <p>Their Bandcamp presence features the album "No Pressure," which includes the brooding title track featuring emotive, dark lyrics such as "killing time before my exodus." This release demonstrates their commitment to exploring themes of existential reflection and emotional intensity while maintaining the sonic characteristics that connect them to the broader tradition of Seattle's dark alternative music scene. The availability of their work on Bandcamp reflects their engagement with contemporary independent music distribution methods.</p>
