            <p>Nerve Filter is a side project by Tom Shear of Assemblage 23, connecting it directly to Seattle's influential futurepop and EBM scene. As part of Shear's broader musical output through his 23db Records operation, Nerve Filter represents the experimental and IDM aspects of Seattle's electronic music community beyond traditional industrial and darkwave genres.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Nerve Filter is an electronic and IDM (Intelligent Dance Music) side project created by Tom Shear of Assemblage 23, launched in 1995 as an outlet for musical exploration beyond the futurepop and EBM frameworks of his primary project. The project allows Shear to experiment with different electronic music styles while maintaining his connection to Seattle's broader electronic music community through his 23db Records operations.</p>
            
            <p>The project's musical approach blends techno, drum'n'bass, ambient, dub, and Detroit electro influences, creating a more diverse electronic palette than Assemblage 23's focused futurepop sound. This genre-blending approach reflects the experimental spirit that has characterized much of Seattle's electronic music scene, where artists often push beyond single-genre constraints to explore broader musical territories.</p>
            
            <p>Nerve Filter's key release "Linear" (2006) is available on Bandcamp and showcases the project's electronic diversity. The project incorporates "a dash of humor" alongside its serious electronic composition, demonstrating Shear's ability to balance artistic experimentation with accessibility. Through Nerve Filter, Shear has contributed to the broader understanding of Seattle's electronic music scene as encompassing not just industrial and darkwave, but also IDM and techno experimentation.</p>
