            <p>Sky Cries Mary is a seminal Seattle psychedelic/industrial/space-rock band formed in the late 1980s by Roderick Wolgamott, representing one of the most significant and long-running experimental acts to emerge from the Pacific Northwest.

            <p>Sky Cries Mary formed in Seattle in the late 1980s under the creative direction of Roderick Wolgamott, beginning their musical journey with raw industrial noise before evolving into a distinctive psychedelic and space-rock sound. This transformation from harsh industrial beginnings to more atmospheric and psychedelic territories reflects the experimental spirit that has characterized much of Seattle's alternative music scene, where artists often push beyond single-genre constraints.</p>

Their music incorporates trance-like psychedelia with space-rock elements, creating immersive compositions that have established them as pioneers in atmospheric alternative music.</p>
