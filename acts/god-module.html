            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>God Module relocated to Washington State in 2006, where the project found a creative home that complemented its dark electronic vision. The Pacific Northwest's atmospheric environment and supportive alternative music community provided the perfect backdrop for the project's evolution, contributing to its most productive period and establishing deep connections within the regional gothic and industrial scenes.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>God Module is a dark-electronic/EBM band formed in 1999, originally in Orlando, Florida, but based in Washington State since 2006. Spearheaded by Jasyn Bangert, the project has become synonymous with what they describe as "Spooky Dance Music," a blend of harsh techno, EBM, and goth that creates an intensely atmospheric yet dancefloor-friendly sound. The project has maintained a consistent presence in the dark electronic scene for over two decades, building a dedicated following through both recorded releases and compelling live performances.</p>
            
            <p>The band's discography includes numerous releases on respected labels such as Metropolis Records, establishing God Module as a significant force in the international dark electronic music scene. Their approach to composition emphasizes both the harsh, driving elements essential to EBM and the melodic, atmospheric components that make their music accessible to a broader gothic audience. This balance has allowed God Module to maintain relevance across multiple generations of dark electronic music fans while consistently pushing the boundaries of the genre.</p>
            
            <p>God Module's influence extends beyond their own recordings through the involvement of key members in other Pacific Northwest gothic and industrial projects. Notably, Byron C. Miller, formerly of God Module, has gone on to lead projects such as Dracula Party and Ghosts in the Graveyard, demonstrating the interconnected nature of Washington State's dark alternative music community. The band maintains an active presence on Bandcamp with releases including the "Cross My Heart" EP (2019) and the single "Unsound" (2019), ensuring their extensive catalog remains accessible to both longtime fans and newcomers to the scene.</p>
