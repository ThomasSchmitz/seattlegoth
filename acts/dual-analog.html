            <p>Dual Analog is a Seattle "turbowave" band featuring Chip Roberts and Kurtis Skinner, who have created a truly genre-defying sound that blends new wave, metal, industrial, and world music into what they describe as "turbowave." Their music combines lush vocals, heavy riffs, poly-rhythmic drums, and retro-futuristic elements to create a unique sonic experience that defies easy categorization.</p>
            
            <p>The band's approach to music-making reflects Seattle's long tradition of genre-blending innovation, taking influences from across the musical spectrum and forging them into something entirely new. Their use of both analog and digital elements in their sound design speaks to their name, creating music that bridges the gap between vintage warmth and modern precision. The duo's commitment to poly-rhythmic complexity and their incorporation of world music elements sets them apart in the Pacific Northwest scene.</p>
            
            <p>Their most recent release, "Sacred Sin" (2025), showcases their evolved sound and demonstrates their continued growth as artists.
