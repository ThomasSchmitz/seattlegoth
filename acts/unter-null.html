            <p>Unter Null is the solo aggrotech project of Erica Dunham, founded in Seattle in 1998, that draws heavily from power noise and industrial music to create aggressive electronic compositions. The project emerged during the late 1990s when Seattle's electronic and industrial music scenes were expanding beyond their early foundations, with Dunham developing a distinctive approach to aggrotech that would gain international recognition and influence within the genre.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout its history, Unter Null has released numerous albums and EPs that have established the project as a significant force within the aggrotech and power noise communities. Notable releases include "The Failure Epiphany" and the "Sacrament EP," which achieved high chart positions in Germany's Alternative Charts (DAC), demonstrating the project's international appeal and the global reach of Seattle's electronic music scene. These successes positioned Unter Null as an ambassador for Pacific Northwest electronic music within the broader international industrial music network.</p>
            
            <p>After over a decade of relative silence, Unter Null marked a strong return with the 2025 comeback single "Coming Up to Breathe," demonstrating the project's enduring relevance and Dunham's continued creative vitality. The project maintains an active Bandcamp presence offering the complete discography, including albums like "Matool," "Cold," "Final Departure," and "Moodkiller," ensuring accessibility for both longtime fans and new listeners discovering the project through contemporary digital distribution channels.</p>
