        <div class="bio">
            <p>Ghosthand is a solo project by Seattle artist Bruce Beerman, active since at least 1997, creating a distinctive blend of synth-pop and alternative music heavily influenced by '80s icons like David Bowie and Prince. The project centers on vocals-driven compositions that showcase Beerman's understanding of classic pop songcraft while incorporating the darker atmospheric elements that characterize much of Seattle's musical output.</p>
            
            <p>The sound of Ghosthand is characterized by nostalgic synth-pop flair combined with contemporary production techniques and a distinctly Pacific Northwest sensibility. Beerman's approach to composition emphasizes melody and vocal delivery, creating songs that feel both familiar and innovative. His work demonstrates a deep appreciation for the golden age of synth-pop while avoiding simple pastiche, instead using those influences as a foundation for more personal and atmospheric material.</p>
            
            <p>The project gained renewed attention with the release of "GHOSTHAND" in 2021, an album that showcased over two decades of musical evolution and refinement. This release demonstrated Beerman's ability to maintain the essential character of the project while incorporating modern production values and a more mature songwriting perspective. The album serves as both a summation of the project's development and a launching point for its continued evolution within Seattle's diverse musical landscape.</p>
