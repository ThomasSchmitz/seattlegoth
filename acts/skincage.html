            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Skincage emerged from Washington State's industrial underground, representing the darker and more aggressive aspects of the Pacific Northwest's electronic music scene with themes of psychological confinement and liberation through harsh sonic expression.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Skincage represented the confrontational and psychologically intense side of Washington State's industrial music scene, creating harsh electronic compositions that explored themes of mental confinement, bodily alienation, and the struggle for authentic self-expression in an increasingly mechanized world. The project's provocative name captured their focus on the intersection between physical and psychological boundaries.</p>
            
            <p>Known for their uncompromising approach to sound design and composition, Skincage utilized aggressive drum programming, distorted vocals, and abrasive synthesizer work to create music that challenged listeners while maintaining underlying rhythmic structures that connected to the broader industrial and EBM traditions. Their aesthetic embraced discomfort as a pathway to genuine emotional catharsis.</p>
            
            <p>The project was part of Washington State's broader network of experimental electronic artists who were pushing the boundaries of industrial music during the digital revolution of the 2000s. Skincage's work represented the continuation of the Pacific Northwest's tradition of creating challenging, innovative music that refused to compromise artistic vision for commercial accessibility, maintaining the region's reputation for uncompromising underground expression.</p>
