            <p>Cruel Velvet is an atmospheric goth project based in Spokane, Washington, representing the eastern Washington gothic scene and bringing dark wave aesthetics to the inland Pacific Northwest.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Cruel Velvet emerged from the shadows of Spokane in autumn 2018, founded by Josh Rodriguez and Taylor D. Waring after the two artists connected through the gothic community on VampireFreaks.com. This digital meeting of minds represents a modern evolution of how gothic artists find collaborators and build communities, bridging geographical distances through shared aesthetic and musical interests. The duo set out to create what they describe as "goth-scapes" - atmospheric soundscapes that weave together the melancholic beauty and haunting darkness that defines the gothic aesthetic.</p>
            
            <p>The band's sound draws heavily from the influential early 2000s Projekt Records compilations, particularly channeling that era's ethereal darkwave and atmospheric gothic music into their own contemporary vision. This influence connects them to a broader tradition of American gothic music that emphasized atmosphere and emotion over traditional rock structures. Their approach combines lush, layered soundscapes with haunting melodies and introspective lyrics, creating music that serves as both an escape and a meditation on darker themes of existence, beauty, and loss.</p>
            
            <p>Cruel Velvet released their debut "Demonstration" EP through Bandcamp, establishing their presence in the Pacific Northwest gothic scene with tracks that showcase their ability to craft immersive atmospheric pieces. Their catalog includes evocative songs like "Angelus," "I Never Feel Alive," and "Blank Planet," which demonstrate their range within the gothic spectrum, from ethereal ambient pieces to more structured darkwave compositions. Each track serves as a window into their gothic worldview, combining electronic textures with emotional depth.</p>
            
            <p>The project represents the continuing vitality of Washington State's gothic music scene beyond the Seattle metropolitan area, proving that the state's darker musical traditions extend throughout its geography. Cruel Velvet continues to develop their sound while maintaining their focus on creating beautiful, melancholic music that captures the essence of modern gothic expression, contributing to the ongoing evolution of Pacific Northwest dark alternative music from their base in Spokane.</p>
