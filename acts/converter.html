            <p>Converter is the rhythmic noise and power noise solo project of Scott Sturgis, representing one of the most uncompromising and influential forces in the international dark electronic music scene. While not originally based in Washington State, the project has maintained significant connections to the Pacific Northwest's industrial and noise music communities through extensive touring and collaborative work.</p>
            
            <p>The project is perhaps best known for its association with the legendary Ant-Zen label, a German imprint that has been instrumental in defining the sound of rhythmic noise and power electronics since the 1990s. Through this association, Converter has released a series of devastating albums that have influenced countless artists in the dark electronic genres.</p>
            
            <p>Converter's discography includes landmark releases such as "Blast Furnace," "Firebloom," "Broken Meat," and "Expansion 1.3," each representing a different facet of Sturgis's ability to craft punishing yet sophisticated electronic compositions. These albums showcase the project's mastery of rhythm, texture, and dynamics within the constraints of the power noise genre.</p>
            
            <p>The collaborative "erode" EP demonstrates Converter's willingness to work with other artists in the scene, creating cross-pollination between different approaches to dark electronic music. This collaborative spirit has helped build bridges between various underground scenes, including those in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
            
            <p>Converter's influence on the Pacific Northwest's industrial and noise scenes cannot be understated. The project's uncompromising approach to rhythm and noise has inspired a generation of artists in Washington State and beyond, contributing to the region's reputation as a breeding ground for innovative and challenging electronic music.</p>
