            <p>Rabbit Junk was formed in Seattle in 2004 and represents one of the most prolific and innovative digital hardcore/industrial metal acts to emerge from the Pacific Northwest.

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Rabbit Junk is a prolific digital hardcore and industrial metal duo formed in Seattle in 2004 by JP Anderson (formerly of The Shizit) and Jennifer "Sum Grrl" Bernert. The project emerged from Seattle's established industrial music scene, with Anderson bringing experience from his previous work in extreme electronic music. The duo's formation represented the evolution of Seattle's industrial music into more aggressive, sample-heavy territories that would define digital hardcore.</p>
            
            <p>The band is notable for their glitchy sampling techniques, aggressive electronic-metal fusion, and rapidly evolving discography that demonstrates consistent artistic development. Their approach to industrial music emphasizes chaotic electronic production combined with metal influences, creating compositions that push the boundaries of both genres while maintaining the confrontational aesthetic characteristic of Seattle's industrial music scene.</p>
            
            <p>Rabbit Junk maintains an active Bandcamp presence that serves as a hub for their extensive catalog, showcasing the duo's prolific output and commitment to documenting their artistic evolution. Their comprehensive online presence reflects the contemporary approach to independent music distribution that has become essential for Seattle's underground electronic and industrial acts. The duo's sustained activity since 2004 demonstrates their significance within both Seattle's local music scene and the broader international digital hardcore and industrial metal communities.</p>
