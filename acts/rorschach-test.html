            <h3>Washington State Connection</h3>
            <p>Rorschach Test relocated from Denver to Seattle where they became influential in the industrial metal scene during the 1990s. Their adoption of Seattle as a home base connected them to the city's industrial and alternative music communities, and their reactivation in the 2010s with new lineups demonstrates their continued ties to the Pacific Northwest music scene.</p>

        <div class="bio">
            <p>Rorschach Test is an industrial metal band founded by James Baker in Denver in the early 1990s that later relocated to Seattle, where they became influential figures in the industrial metal scene. Their move to Seattle connected them to the city's thriving alternative music community during the 1990s, when the Pacific Northwest was becoming a significant center for both mainstream and underground alternative music. This relocation positioned them to contribute to Seattle's reputation as a creative hub for boundary-pushing music.</p>
            
            <p>During their initial active period, the band released influential albums including "Unclean" (1998) and "Peace Minus One" (2000), which established them as significant contributors to the industrial metal genre. These releases showcased their ability to blend the aggressive elements of metal with the electronic and atmospheric components characteristic of industrial music, creating compositions that influenced the development of industrial metal throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
            
            <p>After disbanding in 2002, Rorschach Test reactivated in the 2010s with new lineups and continued releasing material, demonstrating their enduring influence and relevance within the industrial metal community. Their recent activity includes the 2025 "Sectioned out the Fallen Tour" following their new album "Fallen," showing their continued creative vitality and connection to contemporary industrial metal. Their Bandcamp presence maintains access to their catalog and connects them to current independent music distribution networks.</p>
